## HTagLib 1.2.0

* Compiles with GHC 8.4.1.

* Added `Semigroup` instance for `TagSetter`.

* All definitions are re-exported in the `Sound.HTagLib` module, so other
  modules have been hidden.

## HTagLib 1.1.1

* Improved/updated documentation and metadata.

## HTagLib 1.1.0

* Made `getTags`, `getTags'`, `setTags`, and `setTags'` callable from any
  instance of `MonadIO`, not only `IO`.

## HTagLib 1.0.4

* Re-wrote the test suite with Hspec.

* Drop support for GHC 7.6.

## HTagLib 1.0.3

* Export functions instead of record selectors for tag newtype wrappers.
  This is to prevent changes (using record syntax) to values created with
  smart constructors.

## HTagLib 1.0.2

* Modify test suite so it passes with newer versions of TagLib as well.

## HTagLib 1.0.1

* Rewritten setters (without changing the API), so at most one writing
  operation is performed for every settable value. When combining setters
  that happen to set the same tags to different values, value on the left
  side of `mappend` wins.

## HTagLib 1.0.0

* Make the module `Sound.HTagLib.Internal` hidden for end users.

* Make `Text` underlying type for wrappers around textual data (breaking
  change, previously it was `String`).

* Rename functions like `getTitle` to `unTitle` (breaking change).

* Fix bug when wrong data is read from files when current locale specifies
  encoding other than UTF-8.

## HTagLib 0.1.1

* Missing audio samples used for testing are included in distribution.

## HTagLib 0.1.0

* Initial release.
